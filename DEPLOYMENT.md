- Verify your API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### ‚ùå "Failed to initialize chatbot" Error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your Gemini API key has sufficient quota
- Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for detailed error messages

### üîÑ App Not Updating
- Streamlit Cloud automatically restarts when you push to GitHub
- Check that your changes are committed and pushed
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

## Security Notes
- ‚úÖ Your `.env` file is NOT uploaded to GitHub (protected by `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ API keys in Streamlit secrets are encrypted and secure
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to your repository

## Local Development
For local testing, create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Support
